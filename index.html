      <h2><br>About Arcane_Webㅤ</h2>
      <p><br><br> his web would filled with Arcane related canon story, <br>
        most of those are Jinx's though. Ya don't like it? go cry about it. <br>
        the procces of making this is actually fun, also because i can't actually <br>
        made one for my beloved number Five from the Hargreeves family. He's one of my beloved <br>
        at least from my long list of fictional characters that i adore, and those the one <br>
        who can actually made me blush and kickin my feet and shi' <br>
        <br>
        
        Also here's a short story about her : <br>

        Jinx, originally named Powder, was orphaned during a battle between Piltover and Zaun. <br>
        Along with her sister Vi, they were taken in by Vander, a Zaunite defender. Growing up <br>
        in the undercity was tough, and Powder was often criticized for her clumsiness by her adopted <br>
        brother Mylo, though Vi always defended her. <br> 
        <br>        
        Powder, Vi, Mylo, and Claggor decided to break into the Piltover workshop of Jayce Talis <br>
        to steal Hextech crystals. Powder mishandled the crystals, causing an explosion that damaged <br>
        the building and alerted the Piltover Police Enforcers. This led to a chase back to their home in Zaun. <br>
        To protect the children, Vander took responsibility and was arrested. <br>
        However, Zaunite crime lord Silco attacked the Enforcers and kidnapped Vander. <br>
        <br>
        The children attempted to rescue Vander, but Vi told Powder to stay behind. <br>
        Feeling left out, Powder discovered the destructive power of the Hextech crystals <br>
        and created a bomb to help. Unfortunately, the explosion killed Vander, Mylo, and Claggor. <br>
        Devastated by the outcome, Vi called Powder a "jinx" and abandoned her. Traumatized, Powder found <br>
        solace in Silco, who adopted her and she eventually became the chaotic and destructive Jinx. She constantly <br>
        heard the voices of Mylo and Claggor in her head and saw hallucinations of their dead bodies.
